# React, Flux and React-Native
A presentation on React, Flux and React-Native

I've created two prototypes here...
* **react-flux-web** a presentation built with React and Flux
* **luttrellMusic** a music player that plays my music. *Or you can substitute your own JSON y'all*

## React
* Refreshed Components
* Virtual Dom - or Why is React so doggone fast
* JSX - You will be assimilated. Didn’t we stop mixing code syntax?

## Flux
* Unidirectional Data Flow
* What? You mean I don’t have magically bound variables?
* Christian Alfoni's pretty good boiler plate project https://github.com/christianalfoni/flux-react

*One real cool thing real quick* 
Async Display Kit https://code.facebook.com/projects/1475518869403439/asyncdisplaykit/

## React Native
* react-native-cli 
* Native Components

## Flexbox
* cause CSS sucks less than Cassowary Constraints.
* Christopher Chedeau 

##Relay/GraphQL
* You mean I don’t have to write all that damned Flux code? What the hell Facebook?
* This really needs to come out cause dang, Flux is good but is a little too much boilerplate.

## Questions?
* How fast is React?
* Isn't this a lot of boiler plate?
* What about Physics engine?
* What about Sprite Kit, Watch Kit, Health Kit... all of those KITS?
* Isn’t this the same scenario I have to deal with using PhoneGap?
* How does this compare with Titanium or Native Script?
